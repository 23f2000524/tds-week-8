## 📊 Business Context

Christiansen Zboncak and Murazik developed this visualization for a major enterprise client that needed to understand portfolio distribution patterns across business units. A Treemap was selected because it provides:

- Hierarchical market perspective
- Clear proportional scale
- Executive-friendly insights
- Better performance than bar or pie charts for portfolio analysis
